# tlp-paris
LP solver for Simplex Method, based upon Hiller &amp; Lieberman (1974)

This is really just a toolkit that provides a pivot and setup
routines. Features include:
- maximize LP
- minimize LP
- basic oscillation detector with programmable size sliding window

Future work will focus on more loosely coupled analysis routines as
well as a QLP processor that uses Wolfe's method.

Please be in touch if you have any interesting small problems that
are tricky for simplex to solve - I'm interested in this toolkit's
continual development.

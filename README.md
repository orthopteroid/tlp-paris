# tlp-paris
LP solver for Simplex Method, based upon Hiller &amp; Lieberman (1974)

This is really just a toolkit that provides a pivot and setup
routines to maximize or minimize (via dual).

Future work might add a loosely coupled routines for oscillation
detection or a preprocessor for setting up and solving a QLP
via Wolfe's method.

Please be in touch if you have any interesting small problems that
are tricky for simplex to solve - I'm interested in this toolkit's
continual development.

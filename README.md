# tlp-paris
LP solver for Simplex Method, based upon Hiller &amp; Lieberman (1974)

This is really just a toolkit that provides a pivot and setup
routines to maximize or minimize (via dual).

Future work might add a loosely coupled routines for oscillation
detection, or a preprocessor for setting up and solving a QLP
via Wolfe's method.
